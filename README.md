## Project Structure
The project is divided into 3 sections: **Chrome-related code**, **Firefox-related code**, and **Graphics**.  
For the time being, the Chrome folder and Firefox folder are almost the same, the only difference is the manifest file. In the future, It should be changed to a centralized code location, and when building the extension, it will automatically order the folders.
